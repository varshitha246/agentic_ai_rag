# 🤖 Agentic AI RAG Assistant

An Agentic AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions using information retrieved from a provided reference document.

The application combines **LangGraph**, **Pinecone**, **Sentence Transformers**, and **Groq LLM** to provide grounded and context-aware responses.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a RAG-based AI assistant that retrieves relevant information from a vector database and uses an LLM to generate answers based on the retrieved context.

The system follows an agentic workflow using **LangGraph**, where the question passes through different processing stages before the final response is generated.

The chatbot is designed to:

- Retrieve relevant information from the reference material
- Generate answers using retrieved context
- Reduce unsupported or hallucinated responses
- Display the retrieved sources used for generating an answer
- Provide a simple and interactive Streamlit interface

## 🔄 RAG Workflow

### 1. Question

The user enters a question through the Streamlit interface.

### 2. Retrieval

The application searches the Pinecone vector database to retrieve the most relevant chunks from the reference material.

### 3. Generation

The retrieved context is passed to the Groq-powered LLM through the LangGraph workflow.

### 4. Grounding

The LLM generates an answer based on the retrieved reference material rather than relying only on general knowledge.

### 5. Source Display

The application provides an option to view the retrieved sources used during the response generation.
